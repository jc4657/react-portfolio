# React Portfolio

A website developed with React to prove to myself that I have reached working knowledge of this library.

## Description

I learned React so I'm going to try and use React to make a less static portfolio website. I say less static because I don't know exactly how interactive I'm going to make it and I don't want to overpromise, but it should at least be more interactive than my other portfolio website. Portfolios don't really need to be interactive, but I think it'll be more fun for both the developer (me) and potential users (you?).
